I established the course Politicial Data Science Hackathon together with Alex Moltzau in 2022. The course was held six weeks over summer at the International Summer School in 2022 and 2023.

In this course, we collaborated with organizations from work life. They provided a problem statement based on a real-life challenge in their organization, and the students learned data science techniques to work on the problem over the summer. In the end, they wrote a report and held a presentation.

This course attracted students from various disciplines, allowing students to work in cross-disciplinary teams. This led us to also teach some fundamentals about how to work together in diverse teams to learn from and utilize each others' strengths. 

Substantially, students learn fundamental data science techniques such as fundamental R programming with tidyverse, data wrangling, descriptive statistics, data collection, visualization, text analysis, and supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Importantly, they learn why these techniques are useful by applying them to a case.

I have been course convener and lecturer in both 2022 and 2023, lecturing together with Eric Nilsen, Jonas W. Schmid, Sondre Elstad and Louisa Boulaziz.
