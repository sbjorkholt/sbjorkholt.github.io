In 2022, I arranged an Ideathon for the Norwegian ministries together with Alex Moltzau. 

In this Ideathon, we let course participants work in teams to find solutions to exisitng challenges within the ministries.

We collected challenges from employees and made problem statements out of them. Putting the Ideathon participants in teams, we taught techniques for idea generation and agile group work. Then, we supervised the teams as they worked on finding novel solutions the given challenges. 
Two externals were invited in to hold inspiring talks about how they solved challenges in the public sector. On the final day, each team presented their solution to the others, and the participants voted forth one winner team.
