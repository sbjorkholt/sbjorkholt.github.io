In 2022, together with Alex Moltzau, I organized an Ideathon for the Norwegian ministries.

During this event, course participants were grouped into teams to address existing challenges within the ministries. We gathered these challenges directly from employees, formulating them into problem statements for the participants to tackle.

We taught techniques for idea generation and agile group work, then supervised the teams as they developed innovative solutions. The Ideathon featured two external speakers who shared their experiences of overcoming challenges in the public sector, providing inspiration to the participants.

On the final day, each team presented their solutions, and the participants voted to select the winning team.
