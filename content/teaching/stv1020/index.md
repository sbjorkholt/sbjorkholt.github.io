I have held multiple lectures in introductory courses for bachelor students into statistics and quantitative methods. I have held these courses at the University of Oslo, Oslo New University College and the University of South-Eastern Norway.

These courses rely on the book *Fundamentals of Political Science Research* by Paul M. Kellstedt and Guy D. Whitten.

The contents of the course are:

 - Introduction to social science methods
 - Causal inference
 - Research design
 - Data collection
 - Descriptive statistics
 - Bivariate analysis
 - Statistical inference
 - Regression
 - Regression assumptions
