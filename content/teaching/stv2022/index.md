I shared course convening responsibilities and held half the lectures of the Big Text Data course with Martin SÃ¸yland in Autumn 2022. The course is taught in Norwegian.

The course teaches fundamentals within quantitative text analysis and language models, from gathering text data, parsing and preprocessing to models such as sentiment analysis, topic models and supervised learning.
