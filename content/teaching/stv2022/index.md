In Autumn 2022, I co-convened and co-lectured the Big Text Data course with Martin SÃ¸yland. 

This course covers the fundamentals of quantitative text analysis and language models. Topics include gathering, parsing, and preprocessing text data, as well as advanced techniques like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and supervised learning.

Link to the [course book](https://shiny.uio.no/content/1cd1d031-ddef-4e6d-855e-87e3bedc5fd8/notatbok.html#introduksjon) for 2022. Please note that the course material is in Norwegian.
