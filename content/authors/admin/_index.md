## About Me

I am a researcher and data scientist at Statistics Norway, where I work on innovation, R&D, and business dynamics. 
Trained as a political scientist, with a PhD on international governance and standards, I combine domain expertise with methods from data science, including network analysis, text modeling, and web scraping. 
I also enjoy teaching these methods to students and practitioners in the public sector.
