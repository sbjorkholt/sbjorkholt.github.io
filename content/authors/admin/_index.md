## About Me

I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Oslo, specializing in international private governance with a focus on international standards. My research employs data science techniques, including network analysis, web scraping, and language modeling.

I am passionate about teaching quantitative methods to social scientists, and I enjoy working with both students and public sector employees.
