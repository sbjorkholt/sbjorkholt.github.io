      <description>&lt;p&gt;I established the course Politicial Data Science Hackathon together with Alex Moltzau in 2022. The course was held six weeks over summer at the International Summer School in 2022 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this course, we collaborated with organizations from work life. They provided a problem statement based on a real-life challenge in their organization, and the students learned data science techniques to work on the problem over the summer. In the end, they wrote a report and held a presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course attracted students from various disciplines, allowing students to work in cross-disciplinary teams. This led us to also teach some fundamentals about how to work together in diverse teams to learn from and utilize each others&amp;rsquo; strengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substantially, students learn fundamental data science techniques such as fundamental R programming with tidyverse, data wrangling, descriptive statistics, data collection, visualization, text analysis, and supervised and unsupervised machine learning. Importantly, they learn why these techniques are useful by applying them to a case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been course convener and lecturer in both 2022 and 2023, lecturing together with Eric Nilsen, Jonas W. Schmid, Sondre Elstad and Louisa Boulaziz.&lt;/p&gt;
