      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This course integrates team-based problem-solving with real-world work-life cases provided by stakeholders from industry and public sector. Participants also gain hands-on experience with data science methods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alex Moltzau and I established this course in 2022, which has been held over six weeks during the International Summer School in both 2022 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this course, we collaborated with various organizations that provided real-life challenges for our students to address. Students learned data science techniques to tackle these problems, ultimately writing reports and presenting their findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course attracted students from diverse disciplines, fostering cross-disciplinary teamwork. To maximize the benefits of this diversity, we also taught foundational skills for effective collaboration in varied teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students gained practical experience in fundamental data science techniques, including R programming with tidyverse, data wrangling, descriptive statistics, data collection, visualization, text analysis, and supervised and unsupervised machine learning. They applied these techniques to real-world cases, enabling them to understand the utility of these techniques in practical scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the course convener and lecturer, I have taught both years alongside Eric Nilsen, Jonas W. Schmid, Sondre Elstad, and Louisa Boulaziz.&lt;/p&gt;
